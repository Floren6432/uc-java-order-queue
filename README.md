# uc-java-order-queue

A simple Java console food-ordering demo that shows a menu (burger, spaghetti, fries, chicken), lets the user pick an item, and prints the choice and price.

TL;DR: Menu-driven input/output in Java.

Instructions: 
Just download the .zip file, 
then open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace to import it, 
or simply drop the folder into your Eclipse workspace.
